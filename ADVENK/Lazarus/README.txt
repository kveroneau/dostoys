And this here is my most recent attempt at porting/rewriting my "Adventure Kernel" program, but this time, running as a full desktop application!  I thought it was rather cool that I got it working so well, but I will be making some changes to make it even better, as it's using a lot of "legacy Pascal code" instead of using modern classes and such.

This was made in 2020 like the TurboPascal version, but in November instead of May.
