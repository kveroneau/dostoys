In this directory you can see a few examples to understand how the system works, and to try
out something of your own, if you so choose.

## COLOURS.SCR

A test program which allows you to easily cycle through various CGA graphics modes, and the
fonts available.

## HELLO.SCR

A basic hello world type program with a few extra bells and whistles added for good measure.

## LAUNCHER.SCR

An example launcher program, one I was using during development and testing.

## MENU.SCR

Another example launcher program, but much more user-friendly.

## TOOLS.SCR

A program with various testing tools I used during development and testing.

## TESTMAP.SCR

The script for the TEST.MAP and TEST2.MAP, use **MKENGINE.VBD** to build it all.

## TILES.GFX

A RAW export of a basic tileset I created for development and testing of the map engine.

## TEST.MAP / TEST2.MAP

Two example maps with the **TESTMAP.SCR** driving the transition between the two maps.
