I originally wrote this EXC format while writing DOORS2, a Turbo Pascal 4.0 project I've been working on, as a succeessor to DOORS I made in QB back in the day, might have been in ASIC, but it was made a long time ago, and DOORS2 was going to be a full rewrite, but instead of using a text-based mode, it was going to be fully graphical, and I did make it quite far while working on.  I developed a new executable format for my program and bytecode engine, but began to lose interest in developing DOORS2 after I realized how difficult it was to build a coding environment and compiler in MS-DOS using only those technologies, so this program was created to both test EXC programs and to development them.
